# BRIGHTTV VIEWERSHIP ANALYSIS 

# Purpose
This project analyzes BrightTV’s user profiles and viewing sessions to uncover insights that will help the CEO and the Customer Value Management (CVM) team grow the platform’s subscription base and increase content consumption.

# Project Overview
The BrightTV dataset includes:
1. User Profile Data – demographic and account information
2. Viewership Data – detailed session-level consumption records

The analysis supports strategic decision making around user growth and content optimization.

2. Determine factors that influence consumption
3. Analyze viewing behavior by time, day, and content category
4. Identify low-consumption periods and recommend content to boost engagement
5. Recommend user-growth initiatives aligned with BrightTV’s business goals
6. Support insights using SQL analysis and visual dashboards
